hi, i'm 5w14.

i make small projects like games, websites and other stuff i find interesting.

stuff i make/do:

- websites (sveltekit, wanna try react again with nextjs)
- games (godot, but i also know unity)
- web design (figma, duh)

things i am trying to do:

- improve my typing speed (now around 85-100wpm)
- learn more of neovim (i use neovim, btw)
- make more creative things

---

i don't know how people make those cool graphs and stuff at the bottoms of
their readme-s, so i'll leave it empty.

P.S. I know how to use uppercase letters, I just `ggVGu`.
